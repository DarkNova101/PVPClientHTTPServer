Hi!

You dont have GitHub issues enabled for this repo, but you pushed your database credentials to your public repo. 

ANYONE can now access your database. 

This was the best way I could think of about trying to contact you.

I would recomend making this repo private or changing the credentials and not pushing them.

The file I am talking about: https://github.com/zentpvp/PVPClientHTTPServer/blob/releases/config/database.js
